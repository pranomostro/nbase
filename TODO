goldbach [-a] [NUMS]: accept an even number, prints a of all (if called with -a)
	primes that add up to the given number. Pairs are separated by "
	", lists of pairs are separated by ":"
hamming [-l NUM]: print all/the first NUM hamming numbers, sorted ascending
primes [N[-M]]: print all primes up to N or from N to M
factor [NUMS]: print the prime factors of a given number
deterministic prime-checking methods: sieve of eratosthenes (with bit-field and list), brute force checking, sieve of atkin
tree-algorithm and caching for collatz numbers
better algorithms for fib and fact (if they exist)
